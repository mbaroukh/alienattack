# Alien Attack

Trying to learn Godot, I followed the fantastic tutorial on [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/dashboard/courses/13).  
This is a modified version of the Alien Attack game.  
(Note: I understand that the GameDev course is for learning so they don't always show the most optimized solution but instead the solution that will allow the studient to lean the mos effectively).

Most notable difference with GameDev version :

- usage of [inline functions](./scripts/sounds.gd)
- usage of autoload to share [Events](./scripts/events.gd) and [State](./scripts/state.gd)
